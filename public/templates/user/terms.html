    <li>to disrupt the normal flow of dialogue on the Site or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other Users' ability to engage in real-time exchanges and transactions; or</li>
    <li>to violate any applicable local, state, national or international law and any regulations having the force of law.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fish360 reserves the right to monitor usage of the Site.</p>
<p><strong>6. Privacy Policy<br>
</strong>Fish360's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of its Users. In general, Fish360 does not collect "personally identifiable information" about you, except when you knowingly provide such information as the result of the use of one or more of the features of the Site. Although you do not have to provide us with any personal information to visit the Site, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on the Site if you choose not to provide certain information, such as the personal information requested to establish a User account. If you do choose to give us personally identifiable information through the Site, we will collect and retain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We will never ask you for personal information such as your social security number, or any health information concerning you, and such information should not be submitted to Fish360 or posted on this Site. The Site is intended for Users over the age of 18, and is not specifically directed to children under age 13.&nbsp; No personally identifiable information of children should be submitted to or posted on this Site.<br>
<br>
Generally, we use information about our Users to analyze Site usage, to improve our content, products and service offerings and to customize our Site's content, layout, and services to meet our Users' needs. We use information to process User requests, to contact Users regarding their use of, changes to, or new products or services that we offer, and to do internal research on our Users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our Users. We may use information to market our products and related services, including special offers and promotions. These marketing and promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, email or other means.&nbsp; However, the individual or organization will always be given the opportunity to elect to "opt-out" to not to receive further marketing information from us. Finally, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you (such as your purchase of a product or service offered on our Site), or to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Site, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Because these do not involve sending you promotional materials, your opt-out option will not apply permitted transactional or administrative uses of your personal information.<br>
<br>
Fish360's policies regarding the disclosure of User information are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>We do not sell, rent or loan User information to any third party.</li>
    <li>We will obtain permission before disclosing any User information for a purpose not authorized by a User or this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li>We may occasionally aggregate our User information and disclose such information to third parties in aggregate form for a number of business purposes, including running and enhancing the Site. In these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to personally identify our Users.</li>
    <li>Occasionally, we may disclose User information to third parties we engage to facilitate our services. In such instances, we obligate those third parties to conform to our privacy standards. In addition, our corporate policies require that employees with access to confidential information about our Users may not use or disclose the information except for Fish360's business use.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Fish360 may transfer personal information subject to this Privacy Policy to a purchaser in connection with the sale of all or a portion of its business or assets.</li>
</ol>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose or report information about our Users in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, and to protect the rights, safety and security of Fish360, the Site and our Users.&nbsp; Furthermore, we may disclose User information solely as necessary to enforce our Terms of Use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Content; Copyright and Limitations on Use</strong><br>
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes any portion of the Site, use of the Site or access to the Site. The Site is provided for your personal, noncommercial use only.</p>
<p>All information, materials, functions and other content including without limitation, text, software, photos, and graphics (and including Submissions, as defined herein) ("Content") contained on the Site are copyrighted by Fish360 and/or its licensors under United States and international copyright laws, are subject to other intellectual property and proprietary rights and laws, and are owned by Fish360 or its licensors. Fish360 may change the Site or delete Content or features at any time, in any way, for any or no reason.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Except as Fish360 specifically agrees in writing, no Content from the Site may be copied, modified, sold, offered for sale, used, posted, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other than as part of the Site, except that where a feature of the Site is configured to enable the download of particular Content, you may download one copy of such Content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to the Content, and (c) do not use the Content in a manner that suggests an association with any of Fish360's products, services or brands.&nbsp; Any commercial use, "remailing" or high-volume or automated use of the Site is prohibited. You must abide by all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in or attached to any Content.<br>
<br>
<strong>8. Service Subscription; Software</strong><br>
In the event that Fish360 offers a service for on-line access to software on the Site and you pay a service fee to purchase a subscription to access and use such software (the "Service"), or in the event that Fish360 offers downloads of licensed software on the Site and you purchase a license and download such software, the software, including any files, videos, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the "Software") are licensed to you by Fish360 or third-party licensors under the specific terms and restrictions stated in the applicable On-Line Service Agreement or License Agreement (as applicable) accepted by you at the time of initial access and use of such Service or download of the Software (as applicable).&nbsp; Fish360 does not transfer title to the Software or Service to you. You may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or Service or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software or Service to a human-readable form. <br>
<br>
<strong>9.&nbsp; Submissions</strong><br>
For purposes of these Terms of Use, the word "Submissions" means text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, animations, audiovisual works, sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons' names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that you submit, post, upload, embed, display, communicate or otherwise distribute (collectively, "Distribute") on or through the Site. <br>
<br>
There are two types of Submissions: Solicited Submissions and Unsolicited Submissions. "Solicited Submissions" means those Submissions (a) that Fish360 expressly requests or enables you to provide to us via any feature or activity on the Site for Fish360's review or display and possible specifically-defined consideration or compensation (such as being given access to special Site features); and (b) that you Distribute on or through the Site for which you do not seek consideration (such as in Public Forums, as defined below). "Unsolicited Submissions" are any and all Submissions that do not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph. <br>
<br>
<strong>DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ANY UNSOLICITED SUBMISSIONS; NO IMPLIED CONTRACT WILL BE CREATED.<br>
</strong><br>
Fish360's company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Submissions. Fish360 seeks to avoid any confusion when projects developed by Fish360 or under Fish360's direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Fish360 therefore requests that you not Distribute any Unsolicited Submission in any manner to Fish360 directly or indirectly or on or through the Site. Regardless, you agree that any Submissions you make are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and Fish360 in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated consideration that is expressly agreed to by Fish360 after specific negotiation). <br>
<br>
Except as expressly stated, the provisions of these Terms of Use apply equally to Unsolicited Submissions and Solicited Submissions. Accordingly, Fish360, and its licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all Submissions, and Fish360 shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any Submission. <br>
<br>
You hereby grant Fish360 and its licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license under all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify (including removing lyrics and music from any Submission or substituting the lyrics and music in any Submission with music and lyrics selected by us), create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such Submissions, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on the Site, on third party web sites, broadcast and cable networks and stations, broadband and wireless platforms, products and services, on physical media, and in theatrical release) for any and all purposes including entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you, with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity (the "Submissions License"). <br>
<strong><br>
10.&nbsp; Representations Concerning Submissions </strong><br>
By communicating a Submission, you represent and warrant that the Submission and your communication thereof conform to the Rules of Conduct below and other requirements of these Terms of Use and that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such Submission in all manners contemplated by these Terms of Use (including the Submissions License). These Terms of Use (including the Submissions License) do not limit any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to Submissions. <br>
<br>
To the extent Fish360 solicits Submissions through features or activities on or through the Site (including Public Forums (defined below)) that require the use of Fish360's copyrighted works (in whole or in part), Fish360 hereby grants you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work using such copyrighted works (in whole or in part) as required (but only as required, and only for the purpose of creating your Submissions); provided however, that such license shall be conditioned upon your assignment of all rights in the work you create to Fish360. If such rights are not assigned to Fish360, your license to create derivative works using Fish360's copyrighted works (in whole or in part) shall be null and void. You agree to the foregoing grant of rights, consents, agreements and assignments whether or not your Submissions are used by Fish360. <br>
<br>
You hereby appoint Fish360 as your agent with full power to enter into and execute any document and/or do any act Fish360 may consider appropriate to confirm the grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers set forth in these Terms of Use. <br>
<br>
To the extent any "moral rights," "ancillary rights," or similar rights in or to the Submissions exist and are not exclusively owned by Fish360, you agree not to enforce any such rights as to Fish360 or its licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users, and you shall procure the same agreement not to enforce from any others who may possess such rights. <br>
<br>
Without limiting the scope of the Submissions License or any future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments, and waivers you may make with respect to Submissions, you hereby ratify any prior grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers made by you with respect to Submissions submitted by you to Fish360. <br>
<br>
<strong>11.&nbsp; Blog and Public Forum<br>
</strong>For purposes of these Terms of Use, the word "Public Forum" means an area, site or feature offered as part of the Site that offers the opportunity for users to Distribute Submissions for viewing by one or more Site users, including a blog, chat area, message board, instant messaging, mobile messaging, social community environment, profile page, conversation page, and email functions. <br>
<br>
You acknowledge that Public Forums and features offered therein are for public and not private communications, and you have no expectation of privacy with regard to any Submission to a Public Forum. Fish360 cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose through any of these media; you make such disclosures at your own risk. <br>
<br>
You are and shall remain solely responsible for the Submissions you Distribute on or through the Site under your account or otherwise by you in any Public Forum and for the consequences of submitting and posting same. Fish360 has no duty to monitor any Public Forum.</p>
<p>Also, you should be skeptical about information provided by others, and you acknowledge that the use of any Submission posted in any Public Forum is at your own risk. For example, Fish360 is not responsible for, and Fish360 does not endorse, the opinions, advice or recommendations posted or sent by users in any Public Forum and Fish360 specifically disclaims any and all liability in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Fish360 owes you no obligation, and therefore may refuse, to post, deliver, remove, modify or otherwise use or take any action with respect to Submissions you Distribute.</p>
<p><strong>12. Rules of Conduct </strong><br>
The following Rules of Conduct apply to the Site. By using the Site, you agree that you will not Distribute any Submission that:</p>

<strong>23. Miscellaneous</strong><br>
These Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of the agreement between you and Fish360 with respect to the subject matter hereof, and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements or negotiations between you and Fish360 with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and Fish360 shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as applied to agreements made, entered into and performed entirely in Massachusetts by Massachusetts residents, notwithstanding your actual place of residence. All lawsuits arising out of these Terms of Use or out of your use of the Site shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and you and Fish360 hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose. The failure of Fish360 to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms of Use or your use of the Site must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
